                <h2 id="text" class="caption">Pop music had become so popular after the 90s that in the 2000's, Rock began to see a decline and its presence diminished. Pop rock and pop punk became very popular in the 2000's with artists such as Kelly Clarkson and Avril Lavigne sweeping the charts. A new wave of metal emerged called nu metal which was a mix of hip hop, alernative rock, and heavy metal. Emo also became maintstream during this time not only becoming popular on the music charts but as a lifestyle among teens with the style of music becoming associated with fashion and culture. Till this day rock music continues to compete with other emerging genre's such as hip hop, contemporary, and R&B. </h2>
